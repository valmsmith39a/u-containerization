Deployment 
  Environment 
  Dependencies
  App Files

Manually not scalable 

Production/Deployment different in unintended ways

Bundle application with environment and deploy as a unit 

Virtual Machines/Containers 

Environment/Dependencies/App Files deployed as a unit 

Containers: lightweight way of deploying env/dep/files as a unit

Both can be used to horizontally scale an application

Multiple containers/VMs can be run on same machine but containers funning on same machine share same low-level operating system kernel. 

Container:
  OS level virtualization allows run multiple isolated proccesses in parallel. 

  Container is an isolated process consisting of: 
    1. application code 
    2. required dependencies
    3. necessary runtime environment to run application

  Each container is an independent component that can run on it's own and moved from environment to environment. 
  
  Benefits of containers
    Easier for deveopers to create/deploy/run apps
    Containers share single kernel and application libraries
    Less system overhead compared to VMs

How to create containers? 

Several platforms (Container runtime/engines) allow to create containers 

Ex Docker, CRI-O, OpenVZ

Containers are a light-weight option to bundle application with it's environment. 

Virtual Machines 
  Simulate a complete machine 
  Own operating system 
  Not tied to a single executable

  App App  App 
  OS  OS   OS
  Hypervisor
  Infrastructure

  VM is like a complete computer 
    Own operating system and virtual hardware 
    Single physical machine can run many virutal machines 
    Virtualize an entire machine, but resource-intensive

VMs managed on a host machine: 
Host operating system runs the VMs using a hypervisor (creates/manages the VMs)

Containers managed on a host machine:
  Containers bundle application with dependencies. 
  Containers do not have separate Operating System or virtualized hardware. 
  Containers share a single operating system kernel.
  Containers are managed by a container manager 

How to create VMs? 
  use one of the following Hypervisors
    Microsoft Hyper-V
    Oracle VM VirtualBox
    VMWare
    Parallels Desktop

  or Cloud service providers offer ability to create VM on their infrastructure
    AWS EC2
    GCP Compute Engines
    Azure Virutal Machines 

Problem with VMs
  VMs work well for scaling applications they can be resource intensive because they viertualize an entire machine.

Containers are light-weight becaues they run on the shared host OS instead of virtualizing an enitrre OS and system's resources.No operating systems or virtual hardware in container model. 

Recap differences

1. Underlying OS
  VMs: One host, many VMs. Each VM has it's own OS
  Containers: Shared host, many guests

2. Management software
  VMs: hypervisor (ex VirtualBox)
  C: container manager (ex Docker)

3. Resource requirements
  VMs: heavy
  C: light

4. Speed
  VMs: slower
  C: faster

5. Flexibility in chose of OS s/w and h/w configuration
  VMs: total flexibility
  C: limited flexibility

6. Resource constraint
  VMs: Yes. Cannot use h/w resources beyond what is allocated while creating VM. 
  C: No resource constraint. use as much of a resource as host's kernel scheduler allows 

Summary of Benefits of using Containers vs VMs

1. Size: Containers much smaller than VMs, run as isolated proccesses vs virtualized hardware. VMs can be in GBs, while containers are in MBs. 

2. Speed: Virtual Machines can be slow to boot, takes minutes to launch. Container spawns more quickly, typically within seconds. 

3. Composability: Containers designed to be programmatically built and defined as source code. VMs are replicas of conventional computer system. 

***Shared kernels enable containers to be lightweight***
